Welcome Back!

It's been a while since my last post, but you probably know the drill, so lets just get started.

Recently, I've been thinking about my old computer desk I build a few years ago.  It's been in use since I finished it in December 2012, and is begining to show it's problems.  First, the design prevents access to much of the space, and the two-tier layout makes using the accessable space nearly impossible.  So it was time to redesign.

The requirement I imposed initialy were:
- It must use only scrap parts
- It needs to hold the monitors, keyboard, mouse, and motherboard/psu.
- It needs to allow access to the entire space it uses.
- Bonus: it should be able to be used comfortably both sitting down, and standing up.

The first requirement seemed to be pretty well covered thanks to [Fab Lab Tulsa][0] and some generous doners.  The second seemed to be simple enough to solve due to the nature of the design, but is complicated by the third.  Fortunently, by adding the convertable design, the entire design fell into place.

The Solution?

Thinking verticaly.  Literally.
The design ended up as a "tree" shape, mounting the nessecary parts as "branches".  As for the converting option, I build an arm that uses a spring to help prevent the screen from flopping around.
