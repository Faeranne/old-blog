Xkcd-as-a-service now has the Sharks comic avalible!  Also, for those who are picky about their fonts, it now uses the official XKCD font.

If you haven't heard of xkcd-as-a-service, it's sort of like madlibs, but with xkcd comics. Each comic that has been added has a spot on the home page, with a form below to put your words in.  Click the submit query, and a shiny new image with your words is generated.  You'll also be givin a piece of HTML that you can use to include the image on you own site.  How cool is that?

At the moment, there are 3 comics avalible for use, the Regex comic, [208](http://xkcd.com/208), the variant of 208 (sorry, no comic link avalible), and the Sharks comic, [1326](http://xkcd.com/1326).

You can find the generator at [http://xkcdaas.herokuapp.com](http://xkcdaas.herokuapp.com)
