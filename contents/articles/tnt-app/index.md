Once again, I will be developing the Tokyo in Tulsa Mobile app.  Last year was the first year I published the official app, which was so successful that they asked me to do it again.

This year I am building the whole app from scratch, with the notifications wrapped in a phonegap app.  I know phonegap had issues in the past, but Ive found for the features I need, it is perfect.
so far the layout mockups are finished, and the templates are done.  

Untill I get theming info from the TnT staff, the current version can be found in the [Projects Page](/projects/tnt-app.html)
